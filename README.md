## How to use

These scripts are targeted towards use in the tf2cc server. Data from a discord channel that posts relevant logs.tf links is stored as an exmple in tf2cc_logs. This is then converted to a list of results, which is stored in tf2cc_res. Then the results can be used for further processing.
